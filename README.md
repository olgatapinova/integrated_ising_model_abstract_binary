## üìÅ Archive Contents

This archive contains:
- `readme.md` (short), `readme.txt` (detailed)
- `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` for Julia environment
- 4 folders with data from experiments and IIM simulations
- 1 `.jl` and 10 `.ipynb` files with scripts for simulations and analysis

Each script file is self-contained and can be run independently.

## üß† Julia Version

All simulations and data analysis were performed using **Julia 1.11.2**  
Download Julia: [https://julialang.org](https://julialang.org)

### üìã Environment Files

This repository includes two Julia environment files that ensure reproducibility:

- **`Project.toml`**  
  Lists the direct dependencies (packages) required to run the code in this repository.

- **`Manifest.toml`**  
  Records the full dependency graph and exact versions of all packages, including transitive dependencies.  
  This guarantees that the code runs with the same package versions as used in the original simulations and analysis.
